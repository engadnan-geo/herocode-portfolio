        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
          Hi, Iâ€™m a <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong> with a background in{" "}
          <strong>Geology</strong> â€” a bit of an unusual path, I know ðŸ˜„.  
          My journey into tech started when I discovered how creative and
          logical coding could be. Once I wrote my first few lines of code,
          I was hooked â€” it just made sense.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
          Since then, Iâ€™ve been focused on building clean, responsive, and
          high-performing web apps using <strong>Next.js</strong>,
          <strong> React</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, and modern
          databases. I also enjoy exploring <strong>IoT projects</strong>,
          blending hardware with software to create interactive experiences.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
          My work spans everything from small web apps to SaaS-style projects,
          and I love turning ideas into fully functional, user-friendly products.
          Outside of code, Iâ€™m also skilled in <strong>video editing</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>camera operation</strong>, which helps me bring a visual
          storytelling mindset to my development process.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
          When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll usually find me at the{" "}
          <strong>gym</strong>, <strong>reading</strong>, or{" "}
          <strong>walking outdoors</strong> â€” clearing my mind and finding
          inspiration for what to build next.
